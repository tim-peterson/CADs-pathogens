# Figure 1C

- CRISPRi_combine_pvals.py. Code to combining p-values for the six CADs screens.


# Figure 1D

-  CRISPRi_CADs_greater_than2.5.sql: get all genes with greater than 2.5x standard deviations from the mean for all six CADs.

# Figure 3B

- pathogens_screen_count.R: code to visualize the common gene hits identified in
genome-wide screens with the 15 pathogens.

# Figure 4B

- RNAseq_CADs_nonCADs.sql: get all genes with greater than 5x fold change with all CADs where dmso control has a counts per million of greater than 1.


# Figure 4C

[//]: # (- pathogens_transcriptomics.py: gets gene occurrence counts across transcriptional profiling of 13 pathogens.)

# underlying data

- Many of the underlying data was obtained from analysis that can be obtained via https://github.com/tim-peterson/morpheome. Search for CADs, SSRIs, infectious disease (IDs).
