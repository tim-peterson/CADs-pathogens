Combining p-values



# Figure 1D

-  CRISPRi_CADs_greater_than2.5.sql: get all genes with greater than 2.5x standard deviations from the mean for all six CADs.

# Figure S2 

- RNAseq_CADs_nonCADs.sql: get all genes with greater than 5x fold change with all CADs where dmso control has a counts per million of greater than 1.
